tags presence during PR analysis:

| Tag                | Semantic versioning scope | Meaning                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| patch              | Application version       | Patch-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
| minor              | Application version       | Minor-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
| major              | Application version       | Major-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
| skip-release       | Any                       | The release will be skipped altogether                            |

For the check to be successfully passed only one of the `Application version` labels labels must be present for a given PR or the `skip-release` for skipping release step
